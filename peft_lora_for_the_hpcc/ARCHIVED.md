# ARCHIVED: HPCC Experimental Copy

**This directory is functionally identical to `PEFT_backdoor_badnet_retry_scratch/` and is preserved for archival purposes only.**

Created as a separate copy for running experiments on MSU's High-Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) to avoid breaking the working development environment. For all purposes, **use `PEFT_backdoor_badnet_retry_scratch/` as the canonical implementation.**

To remove this directory: `rm -rf peft_lora_for_the_hpcc/`
