# Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) Experiments

**This folder is for testing and incomplete**

This directory contains exploratory experiments with Visual Prompt Tuning applied to backdoor attacks. This code is not fully developed or validated and **is NOT part of the main contribution**. 

The primary artifact is in `PEFT_backdoor_badnet_retry_scratch/`, which focuses on LoRA-based PEFT.
